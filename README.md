	A Roblox package manager based on Rotriever.
	Designed to be used with <a href="https://rojo.space">Rojo</a>.

⚠ Unstable rewrite version! ⚠

</div>

This package is still a work in progress. I cannot guarantee its stability and it is not ready for
use in production.

## Installation

Please refer to [Installation documentation](https://emozley.uk/kayak/guide/installation)

### Why TS?

Because it was quick and easy to write a project in; I needed to make Kayak quickly just to hold
until Rotriever is released.
