Kayak may seem like a complex tool, but it's actually quite simple!

If you find anything that looks like a bug or have ideas for how to improve Kayak, please feel free
to [open an issue](https://github.com/ElliottLMz/kayak/issues/new)!

The [Roblox Open Source Community Discord](https://discord.gg/mhtGUS8) is a good place to get help
with [Rojo](https://rojo.space/docs/help/) and Kayak; questions about kayak are best suited for
the **#general** channel.

Kayak's creator and primary maintainer is also available on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ElliottLMz) and
