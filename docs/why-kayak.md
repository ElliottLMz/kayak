title: Why Kayak?
description: Why you should use Kayak

Managing dependencies is very complicated. Roblox developers generally use
[Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), however, this is not a
perfect solution for a few reasons:

1. Git Submodules does not cleanly handle dependencies; meaning your dependencies will be included
   multiple times.
2. Git Submodules can be really annoying in general.
3. Git Submodules isn't a package manager.

Roblox engineers have created their own package manager called "Rotriever". However, due to
internal obstacles, it has not been released yet. Kayak is designed to mimic the behaviour of
Rotriever until it is released.
